## Description

After natural disasters, it is difficult to track individual movements from one location to another and even harder if the individuals move to a different state or country. For instance, Puerto Ricans have the ability to move from Puerto Rico to the continental U.S. because they are U.S. citizens and are not bound by international restrictions. Puerto Ricans have a unique status that makes it an interesting group to research due to their history, location, and disaster risk. The primary goal of this project is research, compare, analyze, and document migration flows from Puerto Rico to the continental U.S. pre-and-post Hurricanes Irma and Maria. This project uses data from the Census Bureau's Population Estimate Program (PEP) for years 2015-2019.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- OS Monterey Version 12.6.1 
- RStudio 2022.07.2 build 576

### Installing

- Sign-up for a Census Data API key at (https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
- Sign-up for a Mapbox API token at (https://www.mapbox.com)

## Executing project

- Install packages and set-up up library

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(readr)

options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```

- Install Census Data API key
```{r eval=FALSE}
options(tigris_class = "sf")
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
census_api_key("CENSUS KEY")
"install = TRUE"
```

- Create a data frame for Puerto Rico using _tigris_ for state _PR_ for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Save as an rds file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pr_counties <- tigris::counties(state = "PR", cb = TRUE)

pr_counties_flows_2015 <-
  purrr::map_dfr(
    pr_counties$COUNTYFP,
    ~ get_flows(
      geography = "county",
      state = "PR",
      county = .x,
      year = 2015
    )
  )

pr_counties_flows_2015$year <- 2015
```

- Read rds file, create new variable that totals all individuals that moved from Puerto Rico to the continental U.S. by filtering out the areas that are not the U.S.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pr_movedout_summary <-
pr_counties_flows_2015_2019 %>%
  filter(!(FULL2_NAME %in% c("Africa", "Asia", "Central America", 
  "Caribbean", "Europe", "South America", "Puerto Rico")), variable == "MOVEDOUT") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    total_movedout = sum(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
pr_movedout_summary
```

- Use Mapbox API token and load _mapdeck_ to library. 
- Use _get_flows_ to create a map that displaces the migration from Puerto Rico to the continental U.S.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(mapdeck)

sanjuan_inflow <-
  get_flows(
  geography = "county",
  state = "PR",
  county = "San Juan Municipio",
  geometry = TRUE
) %>%
  filter(variable == "MOVEDIN") %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  arrange(desc(estimate))

mapboxapi::mb_access_token("ENTER TOKEN HERE", overwrite=TRUE)

sanjuan_inflow %>%
  slice_max(estimate, n = 30) %>%
  mutate(weight = estimate / 500) %>%
  mapdeck(token = mapboxapi::get_mb_access_token("ENTER TOKEN HERE")) %>%
  add_arc(origin = "centroid2",
          destination = "centroid1",
          stroke_width = "weight",
          update_view = FALSE) 
```
